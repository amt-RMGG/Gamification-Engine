# Test the running application with Postman & newman
We have defined a Postman collection (Badge.postman_collection.json) that you can import. <br>
It will use envrionnement variables, like the api key or last badge id created.
You can also run the collection with Newman to : <br>
- Register a demo application
- Add a badge, a event type and a rule

First you need to install Newman : <br>
`npm install -g newman` <br>
Then run the .json collection file : <br>
`newman run Badge.postman_collection.json` <br>
It will create all the stuff mentionned above and run the test on the status code.
# Build and run the Badge microservice

You can use maven to build and run the REST API implementation from the command line. After invoking the following maven goal, the Spring Boot server will be up and running, listening for connections on port 8080.

```
cd badges-impl/
mvn spring-boot:run
```

You can then access:

* the [API documentation](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html), generated from annotations in the code
* the [API endpoint](http://localhost:8080/), accepting GET and POST requests

You can use curl to invoke the endpoints:

* To retrieve the list of badges previously created:

```
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://localhost:8080/badges'
```

* To create a new badge (beware that in the live documentation, there are extra \ line separators in the JSON payload that cause issues in some shells)

```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' -d '{
  "colour": "red",
  "expirationDate": "2020-11-06",
  "expirationDateTime": "2020-11-06T05:43:27.909Z",
  "kind": "apple",
  "size": "small",
  "weight": "light"
}' 'http://localhost:8080/badges'
```

# Test the Badge microservice by running the executable specification

You can use the Cucumber project to validate the API implementation. Do this when the server is running.

```
cd cd badges-specs/
mvn clean test
```
You will see the test results in the console, but you can also open the file located in `./target/cucumber`
