Feature: Validation of date formats

  Background:
    Given there is a Badges server

  Scenario: the expiration date and time are managed
    Given I have a badge payload
    When I POST the badge payload to the /badges endpoint
    Then I receive a 201 status code with a location header
    When I send a GET to the URL in the location header
    Then I receive a 200 status code
    And I receive a payload that is the same as the badge payload
